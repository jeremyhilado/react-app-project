### Project Description

"Infinite Jokes Generator" will serve up 2-part jokes using a public API. When the new joke button is clicked, a joke is generated. Another button will be clicked to reveal the answer. To generate another joke, click the new joke button again. Other components include About page, header/nav, possibly a footer. This app will be mobile-first design, responsive, using flexbox. Inspiration -- Example of a [dad joke generator site with motion](https://dadjokegenerator.com/)

### API

The API I have chosen is "Official Joke API" -- returns a 2-part joke. No private key required.
**[Official Joke API](https://github.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api)** "The majority of these jokes were contributed by joke-loving coders around the world!" All different themes of fun jokes. [my API link](https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke)
```
{
"id": 354,
"type": "general",
"setup": "Why didnâ€™t the skeleton cross the road?",
"punchline": "Because he had no guts."
}
```
