- _after deployment, add link to deployed app_

### Project Description

"Infinite Jokes Generator" will serve up 2-part jokes using a public API. When the new joke button is clicked, a joke is generated. Another button will be clicked to reveal the answer. To generate another joke, click the new joke button again. Other components include About page, header/nav, possibly a footer. This app will be mobile-first design, responsive, using flexbox. Inspiration -- Example of a [dad joke generator site with motion](https://dadjokegenerator.com/)

### API

The API I have chosen is either 1 "Joke API" or 2 "Official Joke API" -- both return 2-part joke as object. No private key required.

1. "[JokeAPI](https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2) is a RESTful API that serves uniformly and well formatted jokes.
It can be used without any API token, membership, registration or payment. It supports a variety of filters that can be applied to get just the right jokes you need." [my API link](https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/joke/Programming?blacklistFlags=nsfw,religious,political,racist,sexist&type=twopart)

```
{
"category": "Programming",
"type": "twopart",
"setup": "Why does no one like SQLrillex?",
"delivery": "He keeps dropping the database.",
"flags": {
"nsfw": false,
"religious": false,
"political": false,
"racist": false,
"sexist": false
},
"id": 13,
"error": false
}
```

2. [Official Joke API](https://github.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api)"The majority of these jokes were contributed by joke-loving coders around the world!" All different themes of fun jokes. [my API link]((https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke) )
```
{
"id": 354,
"type": "general",
"setup": "Why didnâ€™t the skeleton cross the road?",
"punchline": "Because he had no guts."
}
```
